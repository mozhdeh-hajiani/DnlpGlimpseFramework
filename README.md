This project is a course assignment for Deep NLP, based on the [GLIMPSE](https://github.com/icannos/glimpse-mds) framework:  
**Pragmatically Informative Multi-Document Summarization for Scholarly Reviews**.

We reproduced the original GLIMPSE pipeline on the ICLR 2017 dataset and implemented two key extensions:

### üîß Extensions
1. **Domain Adaptation**:  
   Adapted the GLIMPSE framework to biomedical summarization using a PubMed subset to test generalization across domains.

2. **Model Comparison**:  
   Compared performance of different pretrained abstractive summarization models (BART, PEGASUS, and T5) on peer review summarization.
